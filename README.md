Scenario 5: Voting System (Annual Employee Recognition Awards)
You are developing a simple voting system for a contest. Users can vote for their Favorite option, and 
you need to count the votes.
In a corporate setting, the HR department is organizing the Annual Employee Recognition Awards, 
where employees get the opportunity to vote for their colleagues nominated in different categories. 
The HR team has decided to use a simple voting system to collect and tally votes for the nominees in 
various award categories. The script provided will be utilized for this purpose.
Candidates: The nominees for different award categories, such as "Employee of the Year," "Team 
Player of the Year," and "Innovation Award," are represented by the list of candidates: 'Candidate A,' 
'Candidate B,' and 'Candidate C.'
Voting Process: Employees are requested to input the number of voters participating in the awards. 
Each voter is presented with a list of nominees, and they can vote for their preferred candidate by 
entering the corresponding number.
Validation: The script ensures that the entered vote is within the valid range of candidates. If an 
employee enters an invalid vote, the system prompts them to choose a valid candidate.
Recording Votes: The script records each vote for the selected candidate and prints a confirmation 
message indicating that the vote has been recorded.
Results Display: Once all votes are collected, the system displays the voting results, showing the 
number of votes each candidate received in each category.
Award Winners: Based on the voting results, the HR department can identify the winners for each 
award category and proceed with recognizing and rewarding the selected employees during the 
Annual Employee Recognition Ceremony.
This script provides a straightforward and transparent way for employees to participate in the 
recognition process, fostering a sense of engagement and community within the organization. The 
HR team can use the collected votes to acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of outstanding 
employees in various aspects of their work.
